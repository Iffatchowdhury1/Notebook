    "Message encryption is important and necessary when it comes to sending important information and is used during wars and by banks to just name a few of its usages. There are various ways to encrypt a message, for this project each of the text files was encrypted in the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each message was broken into characters which included letters of words, spaces, punctuation, and $\\n$ which is not seen in the text files but is located at the end of every line. These characters are then arranged in an **n x c** array where c is a random number from 25 to 100. When the **n x c** array is built extra characters needed if the message is too short are done with the use of **&**. c multiplied by n should equal the number of characters that make up the message including the **&** at the end. The array is then transposed, the encrypted message will be the characters that are in the resulting array after removing the **&**.\n",

    "For this project, we are given the encrypted message and must make a function that decrypts the message."
