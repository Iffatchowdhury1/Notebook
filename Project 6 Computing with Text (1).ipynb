    "When it comes to writings some words are used more often than others. The word that comes to mind when it comes to thinking about what word appears most often in writing would be \"the\". I am expecting that the word \"the\" will be one of the words that come up most often in the four text files that we will be analyzing. Additionally, I would think that pronouns would also be used more often than other types of words. Pronouns like \"he\", \"she\", and \"him\" are often used when it comes to writing someone or something, instead of using names of people or places pronouns are usually used in place of them, which is why I think they will be some of the top words to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, many common words are often used it also comes down to what type of text is being analyzed. There are various forms of text where you would not expect words like \"the\" and pronouns to come up often. Text that includes mostly names of people or places would not have as many pronouns used compared to a position paper or any form of academic writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing how often words appear in various forms of text will show trends in how people write across the board. By ranking, the frequencies of how often words are being used will demonstrate trends that exist when it comes to word choice in different types of text."

    "When a text file is being read within Python various things need to be accounted for when using it in your code. For instance, \"ball\" and \"Ball\" are seen as different words by python because one letter is capital in the second case and not in the first case. Likewise, \"ball\", \"ball,\", \"ball?\" and many others are not considered to be the same word. I created the function $count1(filename)$, reads a file, and writes each specific word into a list. When the file is being read it removes '.', '?', '!' and ',', so that punctuation does not impact the frequency that is being determined from each word. \"\\n\" is also being removed, when a file is being read in python there is \"\\n\" at the end of every line. I also made all the letters in the file to be lower case letters so that words would be counted as being the same even if one letter is capital in one word while another is not.\n",

The words \"the\", \"and\", \"of\", \"to\", \"a\", \"in\", \"he\", \"that\", and \"as\" appeared in all four text files. The words \"was\", \"his\", \"with\", \"which\", \"it\", \"for\", and \"i\" appeared in three text files. The words \"had\", \"not\", and \"you\" appeared in two text files. The words \"at\", \"fogg\", \"on\", \"is\", \"be\", \"are\", \"or\", \"they\", \"will\", \"said\", \"her\", \"she\", \"but\", \"jo\", \"my\", \"me\", and \"by\" appear in only one text file. \n",

    "The most common word used in the four texts was overall \"the\", in three of the four files it was the most common word used and it was the second most common in the file that it wasn't. Second place would be \"and\", it was the only word to show up more than \"the\" in only one case and is usually the second most common word in each file. The third most common word to show up across the three txt files is \"of\". The top three positions of each of the list for the four files were either \"the\", \"and\", \"of\", and \"to\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 36 different words compiled by the top twenty words of each of the files, the largest most common word would be \"which\", it showed up in three out of the four top words list for the files. The word \"which\" was also the only five-letter word to end up on any of the lists. The most common four-letter word would be \"that\" would appear in the list of the top words for four files. The second place would be \"with\" that made it onto three of the lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common words to be included in the files are two-letter words and three-letter words, while big words (words over five letters) were less likely to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 36 words most of the words were common and it would not be surprising if you told someone that they were some of the most often used words in text files. However, there are two outliers, which would be \"fogg\" and \"jo\", both of these words made onto the list even though they are not words that people would often use when writing. For example, while I have written this report I used the vast majority of the words included in the list (when I say this I am not counting words that are written in quotations), words like \"fogg\" and \"jo\" don't get used as often. Both \"fogg\" and \"jo\" are only made onto the list of top words for only a single text file, so they mostly have some relevance to the topic of the article, \"jo\" is a relevant name in the file **little.txt** and \"fogg\" was related to the topic of the text file **around_world.txt**."

    "The project demonstrated how certain words are used more often than others. The most common word used hands down by a large margin was the word \"the\". As shown and stated in the introduction this was by no means a surprise. Most people including myself use the word \"the\" several times when writing, A perfect example of this would be to look through the words that I have used in this project (excluding quoted words) and it would not be too surprising to find that the word \"the\" is most commonly used, at the very least it would be the second most used word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common five-letter word will have to be \"which\" since it is the only five-letter word that made it onto any of the top word lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four lists of top words from each of the files contain many similar words, especially when considering the top five words used in each of the files because their positions in each of the lists are very similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 36 different words that made up the four list of top words from each of the files were for the most part easy word that was common and this was not surprising when most people think about what words they use often in their writings they would most likely state words that have made it onto one of the four lists. Words like \"the\", \"and\", \"of\", \"to\", \"a\", \"in\", \"he\", \"that\", and \"as\" appeared in all four text files, they are all easy words that can be used in most sentences. The top three positions of each of the list for the four files was \"the\", \"and\", \"of\", and \"to\", which is not surprising because these words can be easily implemented in any sentence, it is rare to find a paper that does not use these words."
